# BST-for-Word-Frequency-Analysis
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) to efficiently store and manage word frequencies from a text file. It supports operations such as insertion, search, removal, and statistical analysis of word occurrences. The implementation is optimized to avoid unnecessary checks, ensuring the best possible performance.


Features
üåü Core Functionalities
  Insert (insert(String w))
  
    Adds a word to the BST or increases its frequency if it already exists.
    Updates subtreeSize for all affected nodes.
    Optimized to avoid redundant checks.
    
  Search (search(String w))

    Searches for a word in the BST and returns its corresponding WordFreq.
    If the word‚Äôs frequency is above average, it is reinserted at the root to optimize future searches.
  
  Remove (remove(String w))
  
    Removes a word from the BST while maintaining the tree‚Äôs structure.
    Updates subtreeSize accordingly.
    
  Load (load(String filename))

    Reads words from a .txt file, processes them, and inserts them into the BST.
    Handles punctuation removal and character validation.
  
üìä Word Frequency Analysis

  Get Total Words (getTotalWords()) ‚Üí Returns the total number of words stored (O(1)).
  
  Get Distinct Words (getDistinctWords()) ‚Üí Returns the number of unique words (O(1)).
  
  Get Frequency (getFrequency(String w)) ‚Üí Returns the frequency of a specific word (O(log N)).
  
  Get Maximum Frequency (getMaximumFrequency()) ‚Üí Finds the word with the highest frequency (O(N)).
  
  Get Mean Frequency (getMeanFrequency()) ‚Üí Calculates the average word frequency (O(1)).
  
üîç Stopword Management

  Add Stopword (addStopWord(String w)) ‚Üí Inserts a stopword at the front of the list (O(1)).
  
  Remove Stopword (removeStopWord(String w)) ‚Üí Removes a stopword if it exists (O(N)).
  
üñ®Ô∏è Output Methods

  Print Alphabetically (printAlphabetically(PrintStream out)) ‚Üí Prints words in alphabetical order (O(N)).
  
  Print by Frequency (printByFrequency(PrintStream out)) ‚Üí Prints words sorted by frequency using a post-order traversal (O(3N)).
  
Usage

  Run the program from the command line:
    java BSTMain input.txt
  
  Or set the arguments in Eclipse:
